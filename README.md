# No-Show Appointments Dataset

## Description
This dataset is used to complete the first project in the Data Analysis Nano Program and is sourced from Kaggle. It collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil, focusing on whether patients showed up for their appointments. Each row includes various characteristics about the patient, such as their gender, age, appointment details, medical conditions, and whether they received an SMS reminder.

## Dataset Attributes

## Questions for Analysis
1. How is the distribution of patients' age?
2. How is the age group distributed among patients in the Brazilian welfare system?
3. What is the no-show rate of patients within appointment month, based on whether they received an SMS reminder or not?
4. Does the severity of the handicap affect the attendance rate of patients across different age groups?

## Usage
This dataset can be used for exploratory data analysis, statistical analysis, and predictive modeling related to patient attendance for medical appointments.
